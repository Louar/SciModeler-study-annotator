To prove the ‘health status’ of their departments, participantswere requested to track their daily, healthy activities – such as active transport, sports,and fruit intake – using an mHealth solution named GameBus (see e.g.,www.gamebus.eu). The mobile application would then award virtual points for each activity – seeAppendix A for an overview of the number of virtual points awarded per activity– and the health status of a particular department would then be calculated as theaverage number of virtual points scored within that department. During a four-weekcampaign, participants were allowed to claim virtual points for their departments.To review their progress, the mHealth solution allowed participants to compare theirteam performance (i.e., performance of their departments) and individual performancewithin their team. The goal of the competition was to obtain the highest score as ateam. During the campaign, the winning department was promised to receive a cup asproof of winning the ‘TU/e Vitality Challenge 2018’.
