Forthis study, the rewarded activities have been defined in consultation with the school’smanagement and a student council. Several cocreation sessions were held with theaim of defining activities that students were capable of performing, that they wouldenjoy doing, and that would benefit their health. The mHealth tool would then rewardstudents for performing these activities, based on a selfie as proof of conducting theactivity.Users could compare their performance on a leaderboard that summed up the pointsper user. In addition, for the intergroup approaches, additional leaderboards showedper team (ie, per class) the average number of points across team members.

In SCS2 however, students could nottransparently compare their performance with their teachers (other than their ownmentoring teachers) because a teacher’s score was concealed in the average score ofthe class they mentor and can, therefore, not be read by students from other classes.However, Lockwood and Kunda [22] argue that students can draw inspiration from theact of comparing themselves with their teachers, especially if their teachers (slightly)outperform them (ie, triggering upward comparison) [22]. Therefore, to allow studentsto compare themselves with their teachers, SCS3 included two extra teams that werecomposed of teachers only (Figure 1). These two teams included teachers who mentorstudents from the two other treatment groups (ie, the two other educational levels).Therefore, in SCS3, students would collaborate with their class members and mentor-ing teachers to compete against other groups of students and teachers.","notes":"","tags":{"instance":{"ref":"i-ytfzt","label":"intergroup+"},"entity":"Treatment","attribute":"description"}},{"id":"0ekvp","creator":{"id":"RN","name":"Raoul

The active involvement of a role model (eg, a teacher) can influence the aver-age number of unique activities preadolescents perform in an intergroup setting. Forexample, if the role model is active, preadolescents seems more likely to actively par-ticipate as well, because preadolescents are likely to draw inspiration from the actionsof their role models.
